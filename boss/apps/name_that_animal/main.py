    {"name": "Koala", "diet": "Herbivore - almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves. Very selective, eating only certain species of eucalyptus."},
    {"name": "Polar Bear", "diet": "Carnivore - primarily seals, especially ringed seals. Also fish, seabirds, and whale carcasses."},
    {"name": "Orangutan", "diet": "Omnivore - mainly fruits, also bark, insects, and occasionally bird eggs. Spends most time in trees."},
    {"name": "Sea Turtle", "diet": "Omnivore - varies by species; some eat jellyfish and soft-bodied animals, others eat seagrasses and algae."},
    {"name": "Wolf", "diet": "Carnivore - large ungulates like deer, elk, and moose. Pack hunters with complex social structures."},
    {"name": "Hummingbird", "diet": "Omnivore - primarily nectar from flowers, also small insects and spiders for protein. Extremely high metabolism."},
    {"name": "Octopus", "diet": "Carnivore - crabs, fish, mollusks, and shrimp. Highly intelligent with excellent camouflage abilities."},
    {"name": "Kangaroo", "diet": "Herbivore - grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Well-adapted to arid environments with efficient water conservation."},
    {"name": "Tiger", "diet": "Carnivore - large prey including deer, wild boar, and buffalo. Solitary hunters unlike lions."}
