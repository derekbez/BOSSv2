## Archived

This document has been superseded by `external_apis.md` (golden source). All external requirements, environment variable conventions, and per-app API details are now maintained there.

Reason for change: eliminate duplication/contradiction between this file and `external_apis.md`, unify naming under `BOSS_APP_` canonical prefix, and provide transitional mapping for legacy env variable names.

Next steps:
1. Update any app code still using legacy env var names to canonical forms (see transitional mapping in `external_apis.md`).
2. Remove transitional mapping section once code aligned and environment files updated.

Do not edit this archived file further.
