    title: Development Environment & Hardware Emulation
    as: developer
    want: Run B.O.S.S. on my Windows laptop using an emulated GPIO environment
    so_that: I can develop and test the software without requiring physical hardware at all times.
    priority: High
    acceptance_criteria:
      - The system detects when it is running in a non-RPi environment and disables/hides actual hardware calls.
      - A simulated input module is available that mimics button presses and switch state changes.
      - Automated tests pass in the emulated environment.
    status: Complete
    notes: SwitchReader abstraction (with mock) reads the 8-switch value. SevenSegmentDisplay abstraction (with mock) displays the value. AppManager polls the switch and updates the display when the value changes. Tests verify that the display updates only when the switch value changes.

    acceptance_criteria:
      - When I toggle the switches, I see the corresponding number on the 7-segment display
      - When I press the "go" button, I see the joke displayed on the 7-inch screen
    implementation_notes:
      - Switch Mapping: The app should be mapped to a number in config/BOSSsettings.json. For this app, use number 001.
      - Joke Storage: The list of jokes will be a JSON file, stored in the relevant app's folder. There should be an assets folder under the app's sub-folder. A sample JSON file with temporary jokes will be created for initial testing.
      - Display: There will be a requirement to format the text with colour, size, and position in the future. Initially, if no other formats are applied, the text should be centred on the screen and remain until another app is launched.
      - App Structure: All mini-apps should follow the same structure that allows them to be run and terminated by BOSS. No additional user interaction at this time, but future enhancements may allow user-triggered results.
      - Testing: Tests should detect hardware and use mock or real hardware accordingly.
